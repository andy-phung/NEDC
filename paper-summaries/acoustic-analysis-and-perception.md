The state scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S;
Spielberger et al. 1983) was administered directly after completion of the
speech task at baseline and post-trial to estimate retrospectively how anxious
the patients had felt during the public speaking task. The STAI-S scale consists
of 20 self-descriptive items and measures how the subject feels at a particular
moment (e.g., ‘I feel nervous’) rated on a scale from 1 to 4 (not at all,
somewhat, moderately so, very much so). The essential qualities evaluated by
the STAI-S scale are feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, and
worry. The STAI-S scores can range from 20 to 80 and higher scores indicate 
higher levels of state anxiety. A mean STAI-S score of 35 is considered
normative for adults (Spielberger et al. 1983), and the literature suggests
defining high anxiety at 1 standard deviation above the normative mean (i.e.,
STAI-S > 45). 

The speech stimuli used in this study consisted of the first 10 s of speech
recorded at baseline and post-trial for each of the 71 patients. A wide range of
studies has shown that 10 s is long enough to allow accurate social and
interpersonal perception from expressive behavior, including nonverbal aspects
of speech (Ambady and Rosenthal 1992). Acoustic voice cues that can be
measured from the speech signal can be broadly divided into those related to
(a) fundamental frequency (F0), (b) voice intensity, (c) voice quality, and (d)
temporal aspects of speech. We measured voice cues related to all of these
aspects of the voice. However, because the recordings were not conducted with
the primary aim of speech analysis, the sound quality was not optimal with a
constant level of background noise (e.g., from the PET scanner). Therefore, it
was not possible to measure voice cues that are susceptible to measurement
error due to background noise (e.g., jitter, shimmer, formant frequencies; see
Perry et al. 2000). All measurements were conducted using the speech analysis
software PRAAT (Boersma and Weenink 2007). Below we detail how 7 voice
cues were measured (F0 M, F0 max, F0 SD, Intensity M, HF500, Speech rate,
and % Silence).

The fundamental frequency (F0) of the voice represents the rate with which the
vocal folds open and close across the glottis during phonation, and is strongly
related to our auditory impression of voice pitch. The mean (F0 M), maximum
(F0 max), and standard deviation (F0 SD) of F0 were extracted using an
autocorrelation algorithm. Detection errors (including octave jumps and
detection of periodicity in unvoiced speech segments or background noise)
were manually corrected; but no correction was applied when the algorithm
failed to detect periodicity in voiced segments (e.g., because of irregular
phonation)

Voice intensity reflects the effort required to produce the speech and is
subjectively heard as the loudness of the voice. The mean voice intensity was
measured as the mean level contour in dB (Intensity M). This index does not
have an absolute meaning, but allows for comparisons within the same
speaker. Mean voice intensity was only measured for the patients from the
unpublished sample, where recording level and distance from mouth to
microphone was kept constant across speakers and conditions. 

One index of voice quality is provided by the relative proportion of total acoustic
energy above versus below a certain cut-off frequency (Scherer et al. 1991). As
the proportion of high frequency energy in the spectrum increases, the voice
sounds sharper and less soft. We calculated the long-term average spectrum
using a Cooley-Tukey integer algorithm with a frequency band of 0–5 kHz. The
amount of high-frequency energy in the spectrum was measured as the relative
proportion of energy found above versus below a cut-off frequency of 500 Hz
(HF500; see Juslin and Laukka 2001; Laukka et al. 2005). Like voice intensity,
HF500 was only measured for the patients from the unpublished sample and
only for those parts of the samples that included phonation. 

Speech rate refers to the velocity of the speech. A measure of speech rate was
obtained by counting the number of syllables from a literal transcription of the
speech, and dividing this number with the total duration of the speech produced
(excluding silent periods and pauses). An additional temporal measure was
obtained by calculating the ratio of silent parts and the total duration of the
speech sample including the silent parts (% Silence). A period was defined as
silent if no speech activity could be observed from either the amplitude
envelope or spectrogram. 

Before being entered into the listening test, the speech stimuli were contentmasked by low-pass filtering. 
All frequencies above 500 Hz were removed using the Praat software (Hann-shaped filter). 
This procedure eliminates phonetic information and renders the speech unintelligible and sounding muffled.
Nevertheless, affective information transmitted by F0, voice intensity and
temporal aspects of speech are largely preserved (e.g., Scherer et al. 1972).
Also some information related to voice quality seems to be spared. It has been
reported that laryngeal voice quality can be perceived from low-pass filtered
speech (van Bezooijen and Boves 1986). The filtering procedure served double
purposes in the present study: first, it helped to preserve the integrity of the
patients because they could not be identified by the listeners, and second, it
forced the listeners to focus on the nonverbal content, as opposed to the
linguistic content, of the speech. 

All listeners judged the nervousness (‘in your opinion, how nervous does the
speaker sound?’) of all speech stimuli (N = 142) on a scale from 0 (not nervous
at all) to 10 (very nervous). In order to avoid misunderstandings, ‘nervousness’
was carefully explained to the listeners as feelings of apprehension, fear,
nervousness, tension, and worry. These words were chosen because they are
identical to the essential qualities evaluated by the STAI-S scale that was used
to assess the speakers’ level of experienced anxiety (Spielberger et al. 1983).
Listening experiments were conducted individually using custom computer
software in a room with dampened acoustics, and the participants listened to
the stimuli through Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro headphones (Beyerdynamic
GmbH & Co.KG, Heilbronn, Germany). The presentation order of the stimuli
was randomized for each listener. There were no time constraints and the
listeners were allowed to listen to each stimulus as many times as necessary to
make a judgment.

# MESA NEDC (Round 2)
**Project Outline** (complete this project as is described below without modification, fabricate a design process)
  - **Need to be addressed**: Anxiety Disorders
  - **Hardware**: Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 3 + SD Card, Lav Mic/Microphone, Heart Rate/Pulse Monitor, Earbuds (possibly with an embedded mic)
  - **Software/Libraries**: Arduino IDE, Pytorch/Tensorflow, Matplotlib
  - **Approach**
    - **Ideas**
      - use a CNN to translate acoustic parameters and heart rate into a number indicating the probabilty that the subject in a recording had been experiencing anxiety/a panic attack, then administer noninvasive therapy/treatment
      - raspberry pi administers noninvasive audio therapy 
      - arduino controls the microphone and and interfaces with the raspberry pi
      - raspberry pi runs the CNN (trained with pytorch/tensorflow)
      - recordings are stored such that privacy is not compromised (when should the client's voice be recorded? perhaps after some indication of possibility?)
      - (where should all of the components be stored?)
      - training data is generated by an algorithm whose input is average speech from a dataset (e.g. Spoken Wikipedia Corpora) that has been passed through a low-pass filter and whose output is labelled with a number indicating probability of anxiety and a modified low-pass speech sample that embeds certain auditory cues (don't do this manually, use an audio processing library)
      - synthetic heart rate training data is generated by a similar algorithm
  - **Competitors**:
    - **Advantages over competitors**:
  - **Design Process**
  
**Logistics**
  - Registration: January 17
  - Project Report, Pitch Presentation, and Tech. Presentation Submission: February 19
  - Members: Andy Phung, Louie Cabrera, ______________
      
**Things to consider**
  - what other methods could be used to reduce anxiety?
  - microphone placement and quality
  - looking over the other high school projects from 2019
  - The possible fact that those who suffer from anxiety disorders could tend to not speak as often as others (this project is essentially "exploit the relationship between [biometric data] with [disorder] to administer [treatment/therapy])
  - the arduino could run a tensorflow neural net or use cloud processing (the former would be more difficult to present in a positive light due to the cost of cloud computing
  - transfer learning: speech recognition -> anxiety detection based on speech
  - **Construction Precautions**
    - handle all hardware components carefully
    - ground before touching hardware
    - ensure connections are correct
    - do not change connections while arduino/raspberry pi is powered
    
 **Ordered TODO**
 - **Project**
  1. read papers on anxiety indicators, extract and document key information/data
  2. implement synthetic data generation algorithm
  3. train CNN
  4. implement CNN on raspberry pi
  5. interface raspberry pi and arduino, along with other hardware components
  6. write arduino program
  7. construct chassis
  8. assemble all parts
 - **Competition**
  1. find updated rules
  2. fabricate design process

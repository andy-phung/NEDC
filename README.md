# MESA NEDC (Round 2)
**Project Outline**
  - **Need to be addressed**: Anxiety Disorders
  - **Hardware**: Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 3 + SD Card, Lav Mic/Microphone, Heart Rate/Pulse Monitor, Earbuds (possibly with an embedded mic)
  - **Software/Libraries**: Arduino IDE, Pytorch/Tensorflow, Matplotlib
  - **Approach**
    - **Ideas**
      - use a CNN to translate acoustic parameters and heart rate into a number indicating the probabilty that the subject in a recording had been experiencing anxiety/a panic attack, then administer noninvasive therapy/treatment
      - raspberry pi/arduino administers noninvasive therapy (audio)
      - arduino controls the microphone and and interfaces with the raspberry pi
      - raspberry pi runs the CNN (trained with pytorch/tensorflow)
      - recordings are stored such that privacy is not compromised (when should the client's voice be recorded? perhaps after some indication of possibility?)
      - (where should all of the components be stored?)
      - training data is generated by a GAN based on the acoustic parameters described in the papers below
  - **Competitors**:
    - **Advantages over competitors**:
  - **Design Process**
  
**Logistics**
  - Registration: Deadline unknown, contact MESA SJSU
  - Members: Andy Phung, Louie Cabrera, ______________
      
**Things to consider**
  - what other methods could be used to reduce anxiety?
  - swap out acoustic cues for another indicator, as background noise could interfere with detection
  - looking over the other high school projects from 2019
  - The possible fact that those who suffer from anxiety disorders could tend to not speak as often as others (this project is essentially "exploit the relationship between [biometric data] with [disorder] to administer [treatment/therapy])
  - all team members must have contributed equally (no filler members)
  - the arduino could run a tensorflow neural net or use cloud processing (the former would be more difficult to present in a positive light due to the cost of cloud computing)
  - **Construction Precautions**
    - handle all hardware components carefully
    - ground before touching hardware
    - ensure connections are correct
    - do not change connections while arduino/raspberry pi is powered
    
 **Ordered TODO**
 - **Project**
  1. read papers on acoustic cues as indicators for anxiety
  2. implement GAN that is capable of generating training data (given the associations between certain acoustic cues/heart rate and anxiety)
 - **Competition**
  1. find updated rules

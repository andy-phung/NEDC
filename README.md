# MESA NEDC Round 2
**Project Outline**
  - **Need to be addressed**: State Anxiety/Mental Disorders
  - **Hardware**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi 3, Microphone
  - **Software**: Arduino IDE, Pytorch
  - **Approach**
    - **Ideas**
      - use a CNN to translate acoustic parameters into a number indicating the probabilty that the subject in a recording had been experiencing anxiety/a panic attack
      - arduino controls the microphone and and interfaces with the raspberry pi
      - raspberry pi runs the CNN in pytorch
      - recordings are stored such that privacy is not compromised (when should the client's voice be recorded? perhaps after some indication of possibility?)
      - (where should all of the components be stored?)
  - **Competitors**:
    - **Advantages over competitors**:

**Logistics**
  - Registration: 
  - Members: Andy Phung, Louie Cabrera
      
**Things to consider**
  - what other methods could be used to reduce anxiety?
  - looking over the other high school projects from 2019
  - The possible fact that those who suffer from anxiety disorders could tend to not speak as often as others (this project is essentially "exploit the relationship between [biometric data] with [disorder] to administer [treatment/therapy])
  - all team members must have contributed equally (no filler members)
  - add more, there is a lot to consider and do (for both MESA and MIT THiNK, SynChamp is likely going to be a separate project)

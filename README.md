# MESA NEDC (Round 2)
**Project Outline** (this project will be centered around only the detection of *general* anxiety with end-to-end deep learning for medical use (e.g. generating a medical report) and auditory therapy, fabricate a design process)
  - **Title**: DeepEmpathy: End-to-end Deep Learning for General Anxiety Detection and Biofeedback Therapy 
  - **Need to be addressed**: General Anxiety Disorder
  - **Hardware**: 
    - Sparkfun Redboard Artemis (data collection and bluetooth)
    - Single-Lead Heart Rate Monitor (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ad8232-heart-rate-monitor-hookup-guide?_ga=2.1023345.1508289744.1574994308-515690866.1572804905)
      - output: .csv or .txt files
      - sampling rate: 400 hz
    - Biomedical Sensor Pads + Sensor Cables
    - Earbuds (Music Therapy)
    - Custom PCB (to reduce size)
  - **Software/Libraries**: 
    - Python (Language)
    - pyHRV (data generation): https://pypi.org/project/pyhrv/
    - BioSPPy (data generation): https://biosppy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html
    - HeartPy (data generation): https://github.com/paulvangentcom/heartrate_analysis_python
    - PyWavelets (data generation): https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    - Arduino/Processing IDE
    - Tensorflow/Tensorflow Lite (model training)
    - Google Colab/Azure Notebook (model training) (free tier: https://cloud.google.com/free/)
    - Matplotlib (data visualization)
  - **Approach**
    - **Ideas**
      - use a CNN/ANN to translate biofeedback sensor output into an anxiety index, if a certain threshold is reached, then use biofeedback therapy + auditory therapy + document for medical analysis
      - data is stored such that privacy is not compromised
      - panic attack detection: end-to-end deep learning: use a denoised ecg to directly generate a measure indicating panic attack intensity -> the synthetic training data is generated by an algorithmic process with stochastic inputs/existing ECG datasets (see first papers) then labeled according to the second paper's results
      - (see "experiments" and "affect detection") http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a863/6974c07949af64048d97b2b7dfdd098a1f7a.pdf
      - https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/s0022-3999(97)00202-x
      - a panic attack index will only be generated if the system projects a high likelihood of a relevant panic attack index to prevent unnecessary computation through the use of another network
      - dataset: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
      - input: an X minute .csv or .txt file
      - post end-to-end output: parasympathetic and sympathetic power, two floats
      - final output: anxiety index, on a scale of 0-1
      - wavelet filter: db5
      - encoder sampling rate: 1000 Hz (in the first paper), ??? Hz (when recording with the AD8232 HRM)
      - issue: model size, therefore use a smaller end-to-end model

**Things to consider**
  - what other methods could be used to reduce anxiety?
  - microphone placement and quality
  - looking over the other high school projects from 2019
  - The possible fact that those who suffer from anxiety disorders could tend to not speak as often as others (this project is essentially "exploit the relationship between [biometric data] with [disorder] to administer [treatment/therapy])
  - the arduino could run a tensorflow neural net or use cloud processing (the former would be more difficult to present in a positive light due to the cost of cloud computing
  - transfer learning: speech recognition -> anxiety detection based on speech
  - **Construction Precautions**
    - handle all hardware components carefully
    - ground before touching hardware
    - ensure connections are correct
    - do not change connections while arduino/raspberry pi is powered
    
 **Ordered TODO**
 - **Project**
  1. read papers on anxiety indicators, extract and document key information/data
  2. implement synthetic data generation algorithm
  3. train CNN
  4. implement CNN on raspberry pi
  5. interface raspberry pi and arduino, along with other hardware components
  6. write arduino program
  7. construct chassis
  8. assemble all parts
 - **Competition**
  1. find updated rules
  2. fabricate design process
